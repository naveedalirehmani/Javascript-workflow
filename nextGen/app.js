//! question.

//! student marks 
//!  0-35%   -> your grade is F
//!  36-50%  -> your grade is D 
//!  51-60   -> your grade is C
//!  61-80   -> your grade is B
//!  81-90   -> your grade is A
//!  91-100  -> your grade is A+


//? Understanding the problem.

//?  Can I restate the problem?
//?      ->  We are going to create a calculator that calculates a students grade based on their 
//?          marks.

//?  what are the inputs that go into the problem?
//?      ->  your marks in percentage.

//?  what are the expected output to the problem?
//?      ->  Our programe will output the users grade calculated based on the users marks.

//?  Can the output be derived from the input?
//?      ->  Yes.

//?  Labelling the important pieces.
//?      ->  we are going to write pseudo code.


//TODO  take your marks as input and save them in a variable called userMarks.
//TODO  we are going to use if else statements
//TODO      ->  if user marks is greater than 0 & less than 35 we will output Grade F
//TODO      ->  else if user marks are greater than 35 and less than less then 51 we will output D
//TODO      ->  else if user marks are greater than 50 and less than 61 we will output C
